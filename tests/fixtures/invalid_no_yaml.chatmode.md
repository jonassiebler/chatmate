# Invalid Chatmate - No YAML Frontmatter

This chatmate file is missing the required YAML frontmatter section.
It should fail validation tests for proper chatmate format.

## Purpose

Test validation of chatmate files without proper frontmatter.

## Expected Behavior

- Should fail YAML frontmatter validation
- Should be rejected during installation validation
- Used to test error handling in validation scripts
