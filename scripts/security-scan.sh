# Security Analysis Summary

**Date:** $(date)
**Security Grade:** $SECURITY_GRADE
**Total Issues Found:** $TOTAL_ISSUES

## Scan Results

| Tool | Issues Found | Report File |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| govulncheck | $GOVULNCHECK_ISSUES | govulncheck.txt |
| gosec | $GOSEC_ISSUES | gosec.json, gosec.txt |
| staticcheck | $STATICCHECK_ISSUES | staticcheck.txt |
| go vet | $GOVET_ISSUES | govet.txt |

## Binary Analysis

- Binary size: $BINARY_SIZE bytes
- Symbols stripped: $(if nm security-reports/chatmate-security-test >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "No"; else echo "Yes"; fi)
- Static linking: Yes (CGO_ENABLED=0)

## Recommendations

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Run \`go mod tidy\` and check for updates regularly
2. **Monitor vulnerabilities**: Set up automated scanning in CI/CD
3. **Regular security reviews**: Run this script before releases
4. **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated using pkg/security package
5. **File operations**: All file operations use secure path validation

## Security Features Implemented

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Path traversal protection  
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Extension validation
- ✅ Static binary compilation
- ✅ Debug symbol stripping
- ✅ Regular vulnerability scanning
