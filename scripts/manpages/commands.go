ü§ñ What are Chatmates?
Chatmates are specialized AI agents that bring expertise in specific areas:
‚Ä¢ Code Review: Expert code analysis and improvement suggestions
‚Ä¢ Testing: Comprehensive test generation and debugging assistance  
‚Ä¢ Documentation: API docs, README files, and technical writing
‚Ä¢ Issue Resolution: Systematic debugging and problem solving
‚Ä¢ Code Generation: Boilerplate, patterns, and architecture guidance

üöÄ Quick Start:
  chatmate hire        # Install all chatmates (recommended)
  chatmate list        # View available chatmates
  chatmate status      # Check installation status

üí° Common Workflows:
  # First time setup
  chatmate hire
  
  # Check what's installed
  chatmate status
  
  # Install specific chatmates
  chatmate hire "Chatmate - Solve Issue" "Chatmate - Testing"
  
  # Remove chatmates you don't need
  chatmate uninstall "Chatmate: Create PR"`,
		Example: `  # Install all available chatmates (recommended for new users)
  chatmate hire
  
  # List available chatmates with installation status
  chatmate list
  
  # Check VS Code integration and system status
  chatmate status
  
  # Install only specific chatmates
  chatmate hire "Chatmate: Solve Issue" "Chatmate: Testing"
  
  # Remove specific chatmates
  chatmate uninstall "Chatmate - Create PR" "Chatmate - Merge PR"
  
  # Force reinstall all chatmates (useful after updates)
  chatmate hire --force
  
  # View system configuration and paths
