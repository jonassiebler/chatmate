# chatmate ü§ñ

Open source collection of specialized AI agents for VS Code Copilot Chat. Each chatmate is a carefully crafted prompt designed to excel at specific development tasks.

## What are chatmates?

Chatmates are custom Copilot Chatmodes, configured with specialized agentic skills, stored as markdown files. When installed, they become available as specialized assistants in VS Code, each with their own expertise:

- **Solve Issue** - Automatically analyzes and resolves GitHub issues
- **Code Reviewer** - Provides thorough code reviews with security and quality insights  
- **Create PR** - Generates comprehensive pull requests with detailed descriptions
- **Review PR** - Analyzes pull requests for quality, security, and best practices
- **Create Issue** - Creates well-structured GitHub issues with proper templates
- **Optimize Issues** - Improves existing issues for clarity and actionability
- **Create Chatmode** - Helps you build new custom Copilot Chat agents
- **Code Claude Sonnet 4** & **Code GPT-4.1** - Specialized coding assistants

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Global CLI Installation (Recommended)

Install ChatMate globally for the best experience with automatic updates:

```bash
npm install -g chatmate
chatmate hire
```

Then restart VS Code to use your new chatmates.

### Option 2: Direct Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonassiebler/chatmate.git
   cd chatmate
   ```

2. **Install all chatmates:**

   ```bash
   ./hire.sh
   ```

3. **Restart VS Code** to use your new chatmates

## CLI Usage

The ChatMate CLI provides a powerful command-line interface for managing your chatmate agents:

### Install all chatmates
```bash
chatmate hire
```

### Install specific chatmates
```bash
chatmate hire --specific "Solve Issue" "Create PR"
```

### Force reinstall (overwrite existing)
```bash
chatmate hire --force
```

### List available and installed chatmates
```bash
chatmate list
```

### Show only available chatmates
```bash
chatmate list --available
```

### Show only installed chatmates
```bash
chatmate list --installed
```

### Uninstall specific chatmates
```bash
chatmate uninstall "Solve Issue"
```

### Uninstall all chatmates
```bash
chatmate uninstall --all
```

### Check installation status
```bash
chatmate status
```

### Show configuration
```bash
chatmate config --show
```

### Get help
```bash
chatmate --help
chatmate hire --help
```

## Auto-Updates

When installed globally via npm, ChatMate automatically checks for updates and notifies you when new versions are available:

```bash
npm update -g chatmate
```

## Migration from hire.sh

If you've been using the `hire.sh` script, you can easily migrate to the CLI:

1. **Install the CLI globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g chatmate
   ```

2. **The CLI provides the same functionality:**
   - `./hire.sh` ‚Üí `chatmate hire`
   - Plus many additional features like selective installation, status checking, and auto-updates

3. **Keep using hire.sh if preferred** - both methods work identically and maintain the same VS Code integration.
